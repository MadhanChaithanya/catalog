# Vision Statement
Library of Babel: The Good Parts (this could use some workshopping; it needs to be short, memorable, and convey what we're trying to build)

# Mission Statement
What would you do if you had 100 million new friends? What if you had 100 million new friends who were all trying to build something amazing? The value proposition of The CDK is that it brings Cloud Development to the languages developers know and love. This bridge poses a unique challenge in that developers will write CDK Constructs and Libraries in their preferred language and we'll see language fragmentation and tribalism if we don't actively cultivate a community of sharing. 

Our committment to fostering such a community includes building centralized catalog of CDK Constructs that:

* Encourages Construct re-use
* Makes best-practices easy to follow
* Simplifies Construct publishing

To accomplish this mission, we plan to create an open-source Construct Catalog that provides a one-stop-shop for CDK Constructs. New Constructs are automatically added to the catalog and include detailed API documentation and other helpful Construct metadata.
